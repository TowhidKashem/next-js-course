Static Site Deployment:

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "export": "next export",
    "deploy": "cd out && now --public"
  }

  > yarn run build
    * Builds production assets
    * In ".next/" folder there is a BUILD_ID file which contains the id reference to the folder by the same name generated inside the ".next/static" folder 

  > yarn run export
    * This command only needed for static sites
    * Will generate final assets from the aforementioned id folder in the static dir and put it inside a "out" folder at the root ready for deployment 

  > yarn run deploy
    * Above npm script uses Zeit as the platform host but put your own service's command there
